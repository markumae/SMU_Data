Q1-Q2) Two files are worked with for this week's homework: yob2016.txt and yob2015.txt

The files were downloaded using R, and were wrangled according to the R code to meet the requirements for the assignment:
  imported the txt file
  assigned it to "df" dataframe
  displayed both the summary and structure of the file
  removed redundant file with misspellings
  re-saved the final files as an object: y2016 and y2015
  
Q3) Attempted but not completed. 2 days (approx 16 total hours) were dedicated to merging the two completed data sets without success.
